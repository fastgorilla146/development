### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to mimic a store that can sell differnet items and do 
so in an oranized fashion. It allows user to view items, add to card, add/remove from wishlist, 
and sort by prices. 

### Usability Principles Considered

### Organization of Components
The components are split into two main components. One is the Navbar and the other is the Item Data. I put the forms 
where the data is split not into any component because there wasn't much included in the sorting data. 

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Data is passed through the components using state variables and there are lots of state variables that work together
to see what should be displayed and what shouldn't. 

### How the User Triggers State Changes
